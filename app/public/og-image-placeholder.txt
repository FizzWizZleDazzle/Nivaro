# Open Graph Image Placeholder
# This file represents where the og-image.png should be placed
# In a real implementation, you would create a 1200x630 image showing:
# - Nivaro logo/branding
# - "Club Management Platform" text
# - Clean, professional design matching the app's style
# - Key features like "Meetings, Learning, Collaboration"

echo "OG Image placeholder - replace with actual 1200x630 PNG image"
